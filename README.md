Scram and Seek, McDiver Project 
Assignment Completed at Cornell University
Class: Object Oriented Programming in Java

Description: A Java encoded maze dig-hunting game. This game has two stages (Seek) and (Scram). The objective of the first part of the game (Seek) is for the main character (McDiver) to find the ring in the maze in the shortest amount of steps. McDiver digs through the maze until he reachs the ring. Once the reaches the ring McDiver must scram back to the exit as fast as possible in the shortest amount of steps. 

Focused Concepts/Topics:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- GUI components
- Recursion
- Helper Functions
- Depth First Search
- Graphs
- PQueues
- Sets
- Test Cases/Testing

**Instructions to Run/Play the Game:**
1.  Clone repository on machine
2.  Open the the a6 folder in an IDE, preferably (Intellij IDEA)
3.  Go to the Main.java file and run this file to open up the GUI
4.  Increase the speed of McDiver to get to Seek the ring faster

5.  Scram will start once the ring is found and you can increase the speed to get to the exit quicker
