## Verification questions

1. How many coins does your McDiver collect when running with a seed of
   `-4004310660161599891`?

   Answer: 475 coins

## Reflection questions

1. Describe your "scram" strategy at a high level.  How does McDiver decide
   which coin to collect next, and how does he ensure he always escapes in time?
   Also describe how you came up with this strategy and why you settled on it.

   Answer: I first used the initialized the current Node of the McDiver, the exit node of the maze and
   the Maze graph with all the nodes and created an instance of SHortestPath to use to find the best path
   to the exit. Once that was implemented I looped through the edges of the bestPath function made in
   ShortestPath, retrieved the next node from the edge and checked to see if for each edge the source was
   the currentNode of McDiver. If it was then I ensured that the weight of the edge deducted from the source
   edge was not less than 0 and then moved McDiver to corresponding node. (My implementation was not able to fully work)


2. Are you aware of any areas where your submission is not working as intended?
   If so, describe the issue and what you did to try to diagnose it.  Otherwise,
   describe how you verified that your submission fulfilled its requirements.

   Answer: Yes, McDiver would only move to one tile and then it would throw an error, I think this is because of the
   implementation of moving McDiver and then updating the current Node to the nextNode. I believe there was some logical
   errors in the implementation. I also didn't account for specific cases of when you move to an adjacent Node, similar in
   seek(), if the distances between the two Nodes were 0 then I would still continue to move McDiver along instead of it failing


3. Did you implement your own priority queue, or add other new classes to the
   project?  If so, describe them here so your grader is aware of their
   existence.

   Answer: No, I used the priority queue given in the function to keep track of the which edge was of best priority
